Complete Resume Rewrite Feature
Add a "Generate Complete Revised Resume" feature to the resume analysis page:

=== NEW FEATURE REQUIREMENTS ===

On the Resume Analysis Results page (after user uploads and gets the roast/feedback):

ADD NEW BUTTON:
- Below the current analysis results (score, roast points, ATS feedback, keyword suggestions)
- Add prominent button: "Generate Complete Revised Resume"
- Button style: primary/accent color, large and eye-catching
- Icon: ‚ú® or üìù next to text

WHEN BUTTON CLICKED:
1. Show loading state: "AI is rewriting your entire resume... this may take 30 seconds"
2. Call backend endpoint: POST /api/resume/rewrite
3. Send: original resume text + job description (if provided) + previous analysis results
4. Backend calls Gemini API with this prompt:

"You are an expert resume writer. Based on the analysis feedback provided, rewrite this ENTIRE resume from scratch to be significantly better.

ORIGINAL RESUME:
{original_resume_text}

JOB DESCRIPTION (if provided):
{job_description}

ANALYSIS FEEDBACK:
{previous_analysis_results}

REQUIREMENTS FOR THE REWRITTEN RESUME:
1. Keep all the user's actual experience, skills, and education - DO NOT invent anything
2. Restructure for better flow and ATS compatibility
3. Rewrite bullet points to be more impactful using strong action verbs
4. Add quantifiable achievements where the original had vague descriptions
5. Optimize keywords for the target job (if job description provided)
6. Fix all formatting issues mentioned in the analysis
7. Make it concise - remove fluff and redundancy
8. Use professional language throughout
9. Ensure proper sections: Contact Info, Professional Summary, Experience, Education, Skills
10. Make each bullet point achievement-focused, not responsibility-focused

Return the complete rewritten resume in clean, ATS-friendly plain text format. Use this structure:

[NAME]
[Contact Info]

PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
[2-3 compelling sentences]

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
[Company] - [Title] | [Dates]
‚Ä¢ [Achievement-focused bullet]
‚Ä¢ [Achievement-focused bullet]
...

EDUCATION
[Degree] - [School] | [Year]

SKILLS
[Organized skill categories]

Format it ready to copy-paste into a document."

5. Display the rewritten resume in the frontend

FRONTEND DISPLAY:

Create two-column comparison layout:
- LEFT COLUMN: "Your Original Resume"
  * Show original uploaded resume text in read-only textarea
  * Grayed out/muted styling
  
- RIGHT COLUMN: "AI-Revised Resume" 
  * Show completely rewritten resume in editable textarea
  * User can make manual edits to the AI version
  * Highlighted in color (green border or accent color)
  * "This version is optimized for ATS and impact"

BELOW THE COMPARISON:
- Section showing "Key Changes Made":
  * Bullet list of major improvements: "Quantified 8 achievements", "Optimized for 15 keywords", "Restructured experience section", etc.
  * Use checkmarks ‚úì for each improvement

ACTION BUTTONS:
- "Copy Revised Resume" button ‚Üí copies AI version to clipboard, show toast: "Copied!"
- "Download as PDF" button ‚Üí generates PDF of revised resume
- "Download as DOCX" button ‚Üí generates DOCX file of revised resume
- "Start Over" button ‚Üí lets user upload new resume
- "Make Further Edits" ‚Üí keeps the editable textarea active for user customization

KEEP EXISTING FEATURES:
- User still sees the original analysis (score, roast, ATS feedback, specific suggestions)
- The revised resume generation is an ADDITIONAL feature, not replacement
- Both the "specific corrections" and "full rewrite" should be available

CREDITS SYSTEM:
- Free tier: Include this in the 5 resume analyses (1 analysis = roast + optional rewrite)
- Don't charge separately for rewrite - it's part of the analysis
- When user clicks "Generate Revised Resume", show quick note: "Using 1 analysis credit"

OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS:
- Add "Regenerate" button if user wants AI to try again with different style
- Add tone selector: "Professional", "Creative", "Technical" - affects writing style
- Show word count comparison: "Original: 847 words ‚Üí Revised: 623 words (more concise!)"

MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS:
- On mobile, stack the columns vertically instead of side-by-side
- Original resume collapsible accordion
- Revised resume always visible

ERROR HANDLING:
- If Gemini API fails: "Couldn't generate revision right now. Please try again."
- If resume is too short (< 100 words): "Resume seems incomplete. Please upload a full resume."
- If resume is too long (> 3 pages): "Resume is quite long. Consider shortening before rewriting."

Build this feature seamlessly into the existing resume analysis page. Make the comparison view intuitive and the revised resume immediately usable.
